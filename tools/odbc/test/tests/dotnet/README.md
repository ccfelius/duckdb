# duckdbDotNetOdbcTests
System.Data.ODBC test code for DuckDB

Originally written to run in CI, but can be built locally 
using the build.bat. Just run in a standard cmd window. You 
do need Visual Studio 2019/2022 installed. build.bat will discover
the latest version of Visual Studio installed. 

After successful build, run build\Release\SystemDataODBC_tests.exe.

statement ok
create table gutenburg as select * from read_csv_auto('/Users/tomebergen/duckdb/gutenburg.csv');


# whats happening here is that the where subquery queries from an empty table. 
# The whatever alias is properly evaluated, but there ends up being another 
# scan from gutenburg (in reality this query can work using only one scan from gutenburg).
# 

# So then is the subquery select * from unnest(str_split(column0, ' ')))
# able to add the proper delim scan but the other statement is not able
# to do that?
